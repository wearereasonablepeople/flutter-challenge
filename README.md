# Getting started

# What is required to complete the challenge

You are required to create an application that interfaces with the Github REST API v3. 
The application should have a home page that shows all public repositories from 
@wearereasonablepeople, sorted by created date. Users should be able to view individual repository in
a separate page. Within that page they should be able to read the latest commits.

# Business Requirements:

We are looking for all of the requirements to be submitted. This is your chance to impress us so 
feel free to add additional functionality or design.

* Page feed should list all repositories and associated name, description, created date and number of stars, sorted by created date from newest first
* Users can view individual repositories in a separate page
* Each repository page shows a list of commits for that repository

# Technical Requirements

Create an Flutter application which runs in the browser and satisfies the following requirements:

* Two or more distinct widgets demonstrating widgets hierarchy
* A state management layer (feel free to use BLoC, Redux, InheritedWigets or something else...)
